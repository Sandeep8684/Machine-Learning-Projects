# Predicting Employee Attrition Rate with Machine Learning
Leveraging Python and classification algorithms, we tackle the challenge of employee attrition. By analyzing historical data with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, we uncover patterns. Using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM, we forecast attrition rates. Through cross-validation and tuning, we optimize models for accuracy. Insights gleaned help formulate retention strategies.
