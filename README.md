# Predicting Employee Attrition Rate with Machine Learning
**Python**:
       Python serves as the primary programming language for the entire project, from data preprocessing and analysis to model development and deployment.
       Its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries make it well-suited for data science projects.
**NumPy**:
      NumPy is essential for numerical computing and handling arrays, which are fundamental data structures for data manipulation tasks.
      It provides efficient functions for mathematical operations on arrays, such as calculating means, standard deviations, and performing linear algebra operations.
**Pandas**:
          Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures like DataFrame and Series to work with structured data effectively.
          It facilitates tasks such as loading data from various sources (CSV, Excel, SQL databases), data cleaning (handling missing values, removing duplicates), and 
          feature engineering (creating new features, transforming variables).
**Logistic Regression**:
                       Logistic regression is a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks, making it suitable for predicting employee attrition (a 
                       binary outcome - whether an employee leaves or not).
                       It estimates the probability that a given input (features of an employee) belongs to a particular class (attrited or not attrited), based on linear 
                       combinations of the input features.
**Matplotlib and Seaborn**:
                           Matplotlib and Seaborn are Python libraries used for data visualization, which play a crucial role in gaining insights into the dataset and 
                           evaluating model performance.
                           Matplotlib provides a flexible and comprehensive toolkit for creating static, interactive, and publication-quality visualizations.
                           Seaborn builds on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating attractive statistical graphics, making it easier to 
                           visualize complex relationships in the data.:
